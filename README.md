## Best Practices

- Installing Python packages in Jupyter Notebooks
  - [vscode jupyter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/Installing-Python-packages-in-Jupyter-Notebooks)
    - recommends
      - ```%pip install```
      - ```python -m pip install```
    - discourages
      - ```!pip install```
        - as this could install packages in the wronig environment.
